# HelpChat Lab Files

ðŸ‘‰ The PowerPoint presentation, the Jupyter notebook, and code snippets are in the `_GOODIES INSIDE` folder.

> **_NOTE:_** This repo does NOT include the ONNX model because it's too big.
> - You will need to extract the model yourself using the Jupyter notebook
> - Once you get the `zero_shot_classifier.onnx` file, drop it in the AIModels folder (alongside `Labels.cs` and `vocab.txt`)
> - Set its **Build Action** to `Content` and **Copy to Output Directory** to `Copy if newer`
